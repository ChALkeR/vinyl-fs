# vinyl-fs-03-compat

## Warning!

This is an unsupported version of the original [vinyl-fs](https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl-fs) version 0.3.x (which is pretty old), migrated to `graceful-fs` 4.x in order to make it work with Node.js 6.x and above, with the only intention â€” to use this as a transition package.

If you are looking for `vinyl-fs`, you should probably just use recent versions of the original [vinyl-fs](https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl-fs), they are fixed.

This package is not going to be supported and was deprecated the moment it was created.

**DO NOT USE IT.**
